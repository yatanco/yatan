# Hello world - how to make a simple blog?

Having a conversation the other day on starting a blog just to practice making original content I got inspired by my friend who started doing it daily.

She is using this platform http://blot.im to do her blog, which is basically a dropbox folder connected to a bloggin platform, super simple right? So I commented "thats really cool, cause I know I will be looking for a way to just write markdown and get lost in the possibilities". 5 days later here we are, I researched how to install Ghost CMS on runcloud, I checked out blot but didnt want to pay the 4 bucks given I have my own server, so I checked a few different things before finally reaching what I think is the end of my current search.

So whats my setup? I write my content on open source markdown editor http://typora.io and then upload it to http://github.io on github pages, which can be connected to a custom domain name which is where you are now http://rambly.yatan.co.

And thats actually the simplest way I found which even works for people who are not at all techy.

So to inspire myself I am going to steal the quote from http://bitofababble.blot.im that actually got me here to see it whenever I scroll down this markdown file .

When Seth Godin was asked about writing, he shared:

> Everyone should have a blog even if no one reads it. And you should  write every day, even if no one reads it, even if you write it under an  assumed name. The reason is simple. If you go to bed knowing you have to write something when you wake up in the morning, it will become a  productive opening. If you know that you have to make assertions about  how the world is, promises about how you will make the world, it will  make it more likely that you will keep those promises. If you can  describe, in writing, the change you seek to make and who you seek to  change, just the act of computizing it will keep you on track.



So writing as a way of practicing creativity, of practicing verbalizing my experience or ideas in the world, because verbalizing makes them more real, and more like I already accepted them.

Its 27th of December 2020 at the moment this is the first post I got on here. I called it rambly simply because I like that by calling it rambling I am taking a bit of the pressure of me to really see it as a draft of ideas rather than finished products.

Alright so there we go!

Lets publish the first one.
